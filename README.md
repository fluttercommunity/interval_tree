A [Dart][1] implementation of an [interval tree][2], with support for
calculating unions, intersections, and differences between individual
intervals, or entire iterable collections of intervals, such as other
interval trees.

## Mutable

IntervalTree has support for adding and removing intervals, or entire
iterable collections of intervals, such as other interval trees.

## Non-overlapping

IntervalTree automatically joins and splits appropriate intervals at
insertions and removals, respectively, whilst maintaining a collection
of non-overlapping intervals.

## Iterable

IntervalTree is an [iterable collection][3] offering all standard
iterable operations, such as easily accessing the first and last
interval.

## History

IntervalTree started off as a quick and dirty Dart port of Erik
Garrison's [simple C++ interval tree implementation][4], but was soon
re-written and based on [quiver.collection's][6] AVL implementation of
a self-balancing binary tree [AvlTreeSet][7].
